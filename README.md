# sneazingAlexa

This is a piece of software that makes my alexa sneaze throughout the day unless I say bless you. In order for this to work you need to also have created a routine on the alexa app called "bless you" which switchs the node-red device, "You", on. 

This is a node-red + node app. I am sure you can do this all in node-red but I am lazy and didn't. I might fix that later. 

Start the node app and the node-red app then sign in to the amazon console and watch ur alexa become a meanobeano. I use a rasbery pi to host this app permenetly.
